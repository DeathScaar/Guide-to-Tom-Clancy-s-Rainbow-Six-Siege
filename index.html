                    <p class="cat">Rappelling:</p>

                    <p class="subcat">Rappelling is a feature in Rainbow that allows attackers to grapple onto a roof and climb up a wall. Attackers can then climb onto the roof or breach into a window, launching them inside.</p>

                </div>

                    <p class="cat">Destructible Environment:</p>

                    <p class="subcat">In Rainbow, the environment, that is, the walls, hatches, and even reinforcements and barricades are mostly destructible. Walls and hatches that are not reinforced can be broken by breach charges and soft breachers such as ash, zofia, buck, and sledge.</p>

                </div>

                    <p class="cat">Reinforcing:</p>

                    <p class="subcat">Reinforcing is a very common feature inside the game which allows defenders to place metal coverings on destructible walls and hatches. This makes it so no one can shoot through the wall and only hard breachers such as thermite, hibana, maverick, and ace can break the wall.</p>

                    <p class="cat">Cameras:</p>

                    <p class="subcat">Cameras in Rainbow adopt many forms. There are default map cameras which are accessible only by defenders, drones for attackers which allow for intel before breach into the objective. Operators such as valkyrie have special cameras. In her case, she has small cameras that can be thrown anywhere.</p>

                    <p class="subcat">srchough it can sometimes be annoying, team killing is a feature in the game that enables both attackers and defenders to damage and even kill their teammates.</p>
